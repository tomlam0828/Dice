# Rolling Dices Game ðŸ˜„

In this game, you will be rolling two dices with your friends. The first one reaches 100 points will be winning this game.

The Hold button means that you can hold on your score and switch to the next player.

Make sure don't try so hard to get to 100 points because if you rolled 2 of dices 1 then your score will reset right away ðŸ™ƒ. So, the Hold button is your friend. ðŸ¤£

Good luck! And enjoy any challanges you make with your friends.
